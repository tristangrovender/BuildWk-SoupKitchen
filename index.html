      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <p>Our mission is simple: to feed people in need regardless of their circumstances. The Soup Kitchen provides
        healthy and nutritious meals to all who come through our doors.
        We feed the hungry and assist in our humble way to keep families together by providing them nourishment,
        clothing and education. The Soup Kitchen's primary responsibility is to provide a safe, clean, uplifting
        environment for those in need of food and fellowship.
